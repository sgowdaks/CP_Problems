# Example

# d = [100, 85, 93, 106], [10, 9, 10, 11] -> answer 3

# Let's add 75 , d-> [100, 85, 93, 106, 75] 
# for this 75 I can either choose [10] or [9] -> condition 2


# Let's add 65, d -> [100, 85, 93, 106, 75, 65]
# for this if I had picked:
# - [10] that is [10, 9, 10, 11, 10]  -> then I will need a new lower identifier that is [9], so output is 3
# - [9] that is [10, 9, 10, 11, 9]  -> then I can pick [8] and so the output would be 4

# Now let's say we add 110, then the identifier we need to pick depends on the previous value identifier we picked.
